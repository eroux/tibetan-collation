# Resources on Tibetan collation

This repository provides resources on Tibetan collation, including a [simple description](doc/) of Tibetan collation, and [implementations of some algorithms](implementations/).

The documents and implementations in this repository would not have been possible
without the precious help from Åke Persson and [Esukhia](http://esukhia.org/).
