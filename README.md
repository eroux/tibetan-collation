# Testing and improving Tibetan collation

This repository provides tests and improvements of Tibetan sorting.

It currently uses one backend:

- the [Unicode Collation Algorithm](http://unicode.org/reports/tr10/) (UCA)


To use it, you must install Python 3 and [PyICU](http://pyicu.osafoundation.org/).

To run the tests, simply run `./test.py`.
