# Source of collation articles

This directory contains the sources for some articles on Tibetan collation.

## Installation

The articles are made with [LuaTeX](http://luatex.org/), and use a few standard packages.

The directory contains a [git submodule](http://blogs.atlassian.com/2013/03/git-submodules-workflows-tips/) so you must run `git submodule update --init` the first time you want to use these files.

## Compilation

Run `make` to compile the documents (Linux/MacOS only).
